# Fake News Detection
 Welcome to our Fake news detection system using Machine learning and data science. Our platform detects a news headline whether a news headline is fake or real, so lets understand the need of this project and the solution to this.
 ## Why we need fake news detection system ?
## Consider a senerio where a fake news story claims that a dangerous virus has been detected in a particular community, causing symptoms similar to a well-known disease. The misinformation leads to unnecessary panic, overloading local healthcare facilities with concerned residents seeking testing and treatment. The community experiences fear and disruption, while public health resources are strained unnecessarily. This example shows one of the several real-world risks of fake news.
## Project Overview
 Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity , or making money through advertising revenue. However, false news has always been spread throughout history.
 Fake news has become a significant issue in todayâ€™s digital age, where information spreads rapidly through various online platforms. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to automatically determine the authenticity of news articles, providing a valuable tool to combat misinformation.
